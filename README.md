# BODS simulator

**NB This is very much in development and may not be fully functional**

This repository contains code and instructions for simulating beneficial ownership data and writing example outputs in [BODS](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/) format. The code is in the file `bods_simulator.py` and instructions for running the analysis are in the notebook `bods_simulator.ipynb`.

## Run the notebook locally

Clone the repository and navigate to the `bods_simulator` folder. Open the notebook using whichever software you prefer (e.g. [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions).

## Run the notebook on Google Colab

In [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), click 'Upload notebook', then on the 'Github' tab. Paste in the directory of this repository and click the search icon. From here you should be able to open the notebook and follow the instructions, taking care to ensure that the setup commands are followed in full.
